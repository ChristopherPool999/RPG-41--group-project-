# RPG-41--group-project-
This project is a group assignment done in our data structures class. 
This project really helped strengthen our ability to work within a team.
We designated individual tasks based on ability and consistantly checked in with each other to make sure things were going as planned.


Reflecting on my performance on this project, I'm glad I was able to step up and do tasks that weren't mine or improved code that mostly didn't work.
However, assuming a leadership role, in hindset I should've communicated with my team better that their code wasn't functional instead of doing-
everything for some of them. 

I'm happy I have that drive to work harder for the sake of the project, but in reality I should've just had the courage to try and kindly explain-
that some of the code wasn't up to par and I would need them to fix it.
