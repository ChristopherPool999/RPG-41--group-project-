# RPG-41--group-project-
This project is a group assignment done in our data structures class. This project really helped strengthen our ability to work within a team.
We designated individual tasks based on ability and consistantly checked in with each other to make sure things were going as planned.

Reflecting on my performance on this project, I am glad I was able to step up and do tasks that weren't mine or improved code that mostly didn't work.
However, while I did try to step up as some form of a leader, in hindset I should've communicated with my team better that some of their code wasn't functional instead of fixing it for them.

I'm happy I have that drive to work harder for the sake of the project, but in reality I should've just had the courage to try and kindly explain
that some of the code wasn't up to par and I would need them to fix it. We would've all got a better grade had we contributed more equally and had I communicated better.
